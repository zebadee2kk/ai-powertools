# AI PowerTools Roadmap 🗺️

This roadmap outlines the planned development of 50+ components for the AI PowerTools ecosystem.

## 🏁 Phase 1: Foundations (Weeks 1-8)
**Goal:** Launch 6 production-grade core components.

1.  **LLM Router:** Intelligent routing between local (Ollama, llama.cpp) and cloud (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini) models.
2.  **Token & Cost Tracker:** Real-time counter and budget manager with monthly forecasting.
3.  **Session Manager:** State persistence with multiple backends (File, Redis, DB).
4.  **Rate Limiter & Quota Manager:** Adaptive algorithm to prevent API exhaustion.
5.  **Error Handler & Retry:** Exponential backoff, jitter, and circuit breaker patterns.
6.  **Structured Logging Framework:** Contextual logging, metrics, and audit trails.

## 🛠️ Phase 2: Specialized Tools (Weeks 9-14)
**Goal:** Build domain-specific tools on top of the foundation.

*   **GitHub Auto-Setup:** Repository initialization with AI best practices.
*   **Auto-Researcher:** Autonomous crawler for trends and academic papers.
*   **Security Hardening:** Secrets detection and prompt injection scanning.
*   **24/7 Workload Scheduler:** Continuous operation with health monitoring.
*   **Cost Optimizer:** Spend analysis and reduction recommendations.
*   **Monitoring & Alerting:** Real-time metrics and anomaly detection.
*   **Session Replay:** Debugging tools for full execution replay.

## 🎭 Phase 3: High-Level Orchestrators (Weeks 15-20)
**Goal:** Combine multiple components for common patterns.

*   **AI Orchestrator:** The master component for complex AI workflows.
*   **Workflow Engine:** DAG-based execution with parallel tasks.
*   **Advanced Researcher:** Multi-cycle, cross-referencing research agent.
*   **Autonomous Agent Framework:** Goal-oriented planning and reflection.
